COMPANY DATA SECURITY POLICY
----------------------------------------

SECTION 1: PURPOSE
The purpose of this policy is to establish and promote responsible data protection practices within the company.
Our goal is to ensure that all employees, contractors, and third-party partners handle company data in a secure,
compliant, and transparent manner. This document also defines the accountability structure and audit procedures
to verify ongoing compliance with applicable privacy laws such as GDPR, CCPA, and HIPAA.

SECTION 2: SCOPE
This policy applies to all systems, applications, cloud platforms, and devices owned or managed by the company.
It covers digital and physical data including, but not limited to, customer information, employee records,
intellectual property, financial data, and project documents.

SECTION 3: DATA CLASSIFICATION
All company data must be classified into one of the following categories:
1. PUBLIC – Data that may be shared without restriction.
2. INTERNAL – Information used within the company that should not be exposed externally.
3. CONFIDENTIAL – Data requiring restricted access; examples include HR files and contracts.
4. HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL – Sensitive data such as credentials, encryption keys, and medical details.
Proper labeling, encryption, and access control should correspond to each classification level.

SECTION 4: ACCESS CONTROL
Access to information systems shall be granted on a “least privilege” basis. All access requests must be
approved by a department head and reviewed quarterly. Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is mandatory for
remote connections. Service accounts must be rotated every 90 days and disabled if unused for 30 days.

SECTION 5: DATA STORAGE AND RETENTION
All customer and employee data must be stored on encrypted drives or cloud storage with AES-256 encryption.
Data older than five years should be archived and securely deleted if no longer required for business or legal
reasons. Temporary files containing sensitive data must be deleted within 24 hours after use.

SECTION 6: INCIDENT RESPONSE
All security incidents must be reported immediately to the Information Security (InfoSec) team.
Incidents include unauthorized access, data breaches, malware infection, or physical theft of devices.
The InfoSec team shall log each incident, assign a severity level, notify management, and perform a root-cause
analysis within 48 hours. Lessons learned shall be documented in the incident register.

SECTION 7: REMOTE WORK GUIDELINES
Employees working remotely must use company-approved VPNs and ensure devices have up-to-date antivirus software.
Wi-Fi networks must be secured with strong passphrases. Printing or copying confidential data to personal devices
is strictly prohibited. Screens should auto-lock after 10 minutes of inactivity.

SECTION 8: THIRD-PARTY MANAGEMENT
Vendors handling company data must sign a Data Processing Agreement (DPA) and pass annual security assessments.
Access should be limited to the minimum data necessary for contracted work. Breaches by third parties must be
reported to the company within 24 hours of discovery.

SECTION 9: TRAINING AND AWARENESS
All employees must complete annual data-protection and cybersecurity training. New hires should complete initial
training within 30 days of joining. Department heads are responsible for verifying completion and maintaining
records of compliance.

SECTION 10: POLICY REVIEW AND UPDATE
This policy shall be reviewed every twelve months by the Information Security Committee or sooner if new
regulations emerge. Updated versions will be published on the company intranet and communicated to all employees.
Employees are required to acknowledge receipt and understanding of any changes.
